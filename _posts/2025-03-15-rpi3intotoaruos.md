title: "Attempting to add RPi3 into upstream ToaruOS"
---

So, as you may already know by now (if you know anything about me), I really like ToaruOS and its utils.

ToaruOS already has RPi4/400 support. RPi4 doesn't work too well from my testing but RPi400 probably works fine. I don't have an RPi400 but I assume K. Lange does. Why would he add RPi400 support if he didn't have one?

Anyways, I got ToaruOS to run on my RPi3. It didn't take too long. I posted a [discussion](https://github.com/klange/toaruos/discussions/315) about it actually.

Over the time since I posted that, I was thinking to myself:

"Hmm. Could I get my RPi3 support into ToaruOS upstream?"

Last night, from when I wrote this, I submitted an [issue](https://github.com/klange/toaruos/issues/316) to the ToaruOS repo. I hope that it can be merged in eventually.

More to come from this soon.
